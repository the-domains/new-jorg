Once at the airport, show this mobile boarding pass:

- at Curbside where available, Self-Service Kiosks or the American Airlines counter if you are checking baggage,

- at the security checkpoint,

- during the boarding of your flight.

If you forget your cell phone or mobile device, or delete the link to your boarding pass by mistake, you can print a paper boarding pass at a Self Service Machine or American Airlines Ticket Counter.

For your convenience, a paper boarding pass has also been attached to this email. If you have access to a printer, you can print your paper boarding pass(es) before proceeding to the airport. The attached document is not a mobile boarding pass and will not be accepted at the security checkpoint if displayed from your mobile device.
